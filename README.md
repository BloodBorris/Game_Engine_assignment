This interactive media scenario is a level from my GDW game. In this level you must race against the clock to collect three red blocks to continue to the next room. The timer will not start until you have collected at least one of these blocks. Giving the player time to set up and find the quickest path for collection. The player must also avoid hazards such as cameras that slow or remove your time. They can also collect things such as key cards that open doors to help them move faster through the level.

Need screenshots here for the level with short explanations as to why each part is good for the design patterns

I used diagrams to explain how I did each pattern
